Group 5 Final Project
=========================================
**Team Name:**  Group 5<br/>
**Team Members:** Pedro Oliveira, Zak Ahmed, Piranaven Selva


## What is it? 
The project for the course COMP SCI 4TB3 - Syntax Based Tools and Compilers will be to apply the knowledge gained from the course. Group 5, comprised of Pedro, Piranaven \& Zak will work together to enhance Python in four ways. Firstly, adding a Swift-like *External-Internal Function Argument Names* to Python. This would allow a function be called in an expressive, sentence-like manner, while still providing a function body that is readable and clear in intent.  After this,  we will add two language constructs: *Do-While Loops* & *Switch-Case Statements*. Lastly, we will add Python function definitions with *Pattern Matching* as seen in functional programming. These would provide developers with more flexibility. Overall, this project will enhance our knowledge of Python Virtual Machines, the CPython grammar and much more.
